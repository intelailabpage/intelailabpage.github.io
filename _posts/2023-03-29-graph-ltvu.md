<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Graph-LTVU is an open-sourced toolbox for long-term video understanding based on spatio-temporal graph-based representations.This library is based on PyTorch and PyTorchGeometric. It is designed to serve as a spatial-temporal graph learning framework for multiple video understanding tasks. In the current version, it supports training and evaluating one of the state-of-the-art models, SPELL, for the tasks of active speaker detection and action localization.

In the near future, we will release more advanced graph-based approaches for other tasks, including action segmentation and the Ego4D challenge.
