Intel Labs recently released the Open MatSci ML Toolkit version 1.0 on August 31, making training of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models on 
materials data more accessible for materials evaluation and discovery. Complex societal challenges, such as climate change, sustainable agriculture, 
and compute accessibility, rely heavily on the discovery of new materials systems. The vast design space in materials design, and the complex physical 
and chemical relationships in applications requires advanced AI tools to evaluate and discover new materials more efficiently.
