excerpt: "Current video understanding systems accurately recognize patterns in short video clips, but fails to process a video content over a few seconds due to computation and memory bottleneck. We propose a video representation method based on a spatio-temporal graph learning (SPELL) to equip it with long-term reasoning ability... "

We explore novel video representations methods that are equipped with long-form reasoning capability.
