excerpt: "To address the current restrictions on knowing accurate camera poses a-priori as well as lengthy training time, we propose a novel approach called Bundle-Adjusting Accelerated Graphics Primitives (BAA-NGP) that can learn to estimate camera poses and optimize the radiance field simultaneously with 10 to 20 times speedup...
