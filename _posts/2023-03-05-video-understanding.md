Current video understanding systems accurately recognize patterns in short video clips. 
However, they fail to capture how the present connects to the past or future in a world of never-ending visual stimuli. 
Existing video architectures tend to hit computation or memory bottlenecks after processing only a few seconds of video content. 
So, how do we enable accurate and efficient long-term visual understanding? An important first step is to have a model that practically 
runs on long videos. To that end, we propose a novel video representation method based on Spatio-Temporal Graphs Learning (SPELL) to equip 
it with long-term reasoning capability.
